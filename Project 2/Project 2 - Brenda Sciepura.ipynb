    "## This boxplot shows that the mean of the diabetes median is slightly below 10% but it's a skewed distribution due to the high number of outliers in the upper end of the distribution. This means that there are some counties in the country with a very high diabetes rate, that would probably be skewing the mean upwards. "

    "## We observe a strong positive correlation between diabetes rates and physical inactivity rates, which means that being physically inactive is associated with experience of diabetes. However, this could also be due to the fact that physically inactive individuals are more likely to be overweight, so we're maybe already uncovering this relationship in the previous graph.  "

    "Bias comes from the inability of a simplified model to approximate a complex real-world problem. Because the model makes some assumptions about the data that are not entirely accurate, it underfits the training data. Variance comes from random noise in the data which accounts for how much the model predictions would vary if they’re trained with different subsets of the data. Underfitting occurs when a model is not complex enough to accurately capture underlying data relationships. It performs poorly on the training and test data. The overall relationships between these 4 terms can be summarized as follows: a model with small variance and high bias will underfit (because it’s not capturing the underlying relationship of the data well), whereas a model with high variance and small bias will overfit (the model has a lot of data to truly capture the underlying data relationship but does not generalize well). In ML you worry more about the latter because of its inherent characteristics: large number of features and complex models. "

    "Overfitting is an analysis that corresponds too closely or exactly to a particular set of data, which means the data is fitted too well and so it performs poorly on new data because it fails to make generalization of the underlying data patterns. The chance of overfitting increases with a higher dimensional model because you have more features to better fit the model and understand underlying patterns in the data, you have more flexibility, but the model is less generalizable. Regularization is a technique to prevent overfitting. It adds a penalty term for model complexity. The goal in ML is to find the right level of regularization that minimizes the error on the training and test data so that the model can make good generalizations when applied to new data, and this is how it’s connected to the bias-variance tradeoff. Regularization aims at finding the best balance between this too to achieve good model generalization. "
